# Draft Strategy Sim

Draft Strategy Sim is a web application that allows the user to select their positional draft strategy and simulate a season to see how each selected position contributes to the starting lineup on a weekly basis. This simulator runs a Monte Carlo simulation with 100,000 iterations to determine how much each selection is projected to score in a given week and how often they are included in the starting lineup.

Built using Python Django, MongoDB, and ReactJS.

Web application is live at [draftstrategysim.com](https://www.draftstrategysim.com)
